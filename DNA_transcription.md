# DNA Transcription
Students are separated into groups to discuss and create a presentation slide about DNA transcription.

The slides involve:
1) Define promoter and its importance in transcription
2) Explain the role of the sigma subunit in promoter recognition
3) Explain how consensus sequences affect promoter strength
4) Explain the difference of promoters in prokaryotes and eukaryotic
5) Understand and explain mechanisms of promoter recognition and initiation  in transcription
   
We created a slide that will make it easier for listeners to understand the complicated mechanism using the form of tables, graphics, and mindmaps.:

**Reflection:**
Creating these slides not only will help our classmates to better understand DNA transcription but will also give us a great chance to memorize the complicated mechanism, it is a total win-win situation I appreciate it.
