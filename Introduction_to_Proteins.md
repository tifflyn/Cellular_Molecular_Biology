# Introduction To Proteins
## Mindmap
Students are separated into groups to discuss and create a mindmap that will be useful for future revision.
After brainstorming together we come out the mindmap for introduction to protein as follows:

**Reflection:**
Although there are some arguments on task distribution and what essential points to display on the mindmap, I truly appreciate the communication back and forth during the discussion. It will strengthen my soft skills
as well as knowledge about proteins during those arguments.
